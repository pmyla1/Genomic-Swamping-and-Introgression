# Genomic-Swamping-and-Introgression
This repository should allow the user to reproduce an analysis of the extent of introgression between the invasive hexaploid Cochlearia danica and native species Cochlearia officianalis, utilising tools such as Dsuite and Twisst. 

# Background



# Installation of Software and Dependencies

## Dsuite
[Dsuite](https://github.com/millanek/Dsuite) is a software program developed to quickly calculate Patterson's D (ABBA-BABA), and the f4-ratio statistics across many populations and/or species.

To install the program on macOS run the following commands for the main program:

```
git clone https://github.com/millanek/Dsuite.git
cd Dsuite
make
```

In order to execute Dsuite commands (e.g. Dtrios), you can navigate to the Build folder and run the Dsuite executable with the following command `./Build/Dsuite` which shows the available commands. To execute the Dtrios command you can type `./Build/Dsuite Dtrios`.
